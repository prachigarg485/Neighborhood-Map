# Udacity Project: Neighborhood Map

##  Overview of Project
It displays a map with pupular cities of Punjab, India in the neighborhood of my city ("Patiala") where I live in. There is a button named menu that toggles the navigation sidebar. If you click in a location on the side bar or in one of the markers in the map, it will query wikipedia's API for articles related to the location name and display links in a infoWindow. You can also filter the locations by typing into the input box located at the top of the navigation sidebar.
